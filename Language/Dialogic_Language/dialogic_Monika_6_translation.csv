Text/91/text,有多久了呢？啊，我是在说“莫妮卡的写作小技巧”,"How long has it been? Ah, I’m talking about 'Monika’s Writing Tips."
Text/92/text,那么开始了哦~,"Alright, here we go~"
Text/93/text,你知道吗？每个作家都会遇到那种写到一半突然卡壳的时刻，仿佛突然被堵住了灵感的出口。,"You know, every writer faces those moments when they suddenly hit a block, as if the flow of inspiration has been completely blocked."
Text/94/text,嗯，感觉就是有点像你明明知道要走出这条路，但好像脚步变得沉重了。,"Hmm, it feels a bit like when you know exactly where you need to go, but your steps suddenly feel heavy."
Text/95/text,所以，这时候要做的第一件事就是跳出惯性的思维！我知道这听起来有点像玩文字游戏，但其实非常有用哦。,"So, the first thing to do is to break out of habitual thinking! I know this might sound like a word game, but it's actually very effective."
Text/96/text,"举个简单的例子：
如果你平时习惯了按照时间顺序来写作，试着逆序——从结局开始写，然后慢慢倒推故事的发展。","Here’s a simple example:
If you’re used to writing in chronological order, try writing in reverse — start from the ending and then slowly work your way backward through the story."
Text/97/text,"或者，你可以尝试让一个角色突然“跳脱”常规，做一些你之前完全没想到的事。
这样不仅能给你带来新的思路，还能打破“常规写作”带来的思维束缚。","Or, you could try having a character suddenly 'break free' from the norm and do something you never imagined them doing before.
Not only will this bring fresh ideas, but it will also break the mental constraints of 'conventional writing."
Text/98/text,"另外，别害怕失败。有时候，写作中的瓶颈来自于对完美的过度追求。其实，最重要的是你得先把东西写出来！
不管是草稿还是大纲，写下来后你可以随时修改，但开始才是关键。","Also, don’t be afraid of failure. Sometimes, the writing block comes from an overzealous pursuit of perfection. The most important thing is to just get something down on paper!
Whether it's a draft or an outline, once it’s written, you can always revise it later. But starting is the key.
