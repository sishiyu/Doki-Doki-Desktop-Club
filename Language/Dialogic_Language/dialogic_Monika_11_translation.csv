Text/51/text,"书里的世界总是能带给我很多惊喜。每当我翻开一本新书，仿佛就进入了一个完全不同的时空。
我喜欢在文字之间徜徉，感受每个角色的喜怒哀乐，随着剧情的起伏一起心跳加速，或者沉浸在某个安静的瞬间。","The world in books always brings me so many surprises. Every time I open a new book, it feels like stepping into a completely different time and space. 
I love wandering between the words, feeling each character's joys, anger, sorrow, and happiness, racing along with the plot’s ups and downs, or immersing myself in a quiet moment."
Text/52/text,有时候，书中的人物似乎变得不再是虚构的存在，反而变成了我某种意义上的朋友，和我分享他们的世界与心情。,"Sometimes, the characters in the books seem to stop being mere fictional beings and instead become, in a sense, my friends, sharing with me their worlds and emotions."
