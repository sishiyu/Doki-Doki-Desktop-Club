Text/b8/text,运动对我来说有时候还挺重要的，虽然我平时不太喜欢太剧烈的那种。喜欢一些可以自己控制节奏的，比如慢跑之类的。,"Exercise is sometimes quite important to me, although I don’t really like intense activities. 
I prefer things where I can control the pace, like jogging."
Text/b9/text,跑步不需要太多人陪着，也不用太多的器械，只要听着音乐，自己一个人跑跑，能清理下脑袋里的那些杂乱的东西。,Running doesn’t require too many people around or a lot of equipment. Just listen to music and run alone—it helps clear the clutter in my mind.
Text/ba/text,你也知道，生活总是有些时候让人烦躁，跑步能让我暂时不去想那些事情。,"You know, life can sometimes be frustrating, and running lets me temporarily stop thinking about those things."
Text/bb/text,不是说我在劝你做什么啦，只是有时候如果压力大，适当运动一下能帮助你放松，谁说不是呢？(￣▽￣),"I’m not saying I’m trying to convince you to do anything, but sometimes, if you're under a lot of pressure, some exercise can help you relax. Who says it doesn’t?"" (￣▽￣)"
Text/bc/text,不过，你要是觉得麻烦，不想动也行。我才不管你怎么样。,"But, if you find it troublesome and don’t want to move, that’s fine too. I don’t really care what you do."
