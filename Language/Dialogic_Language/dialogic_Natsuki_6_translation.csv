Text/bf/text,电影……嗯，我比较喜欢喜剧，一部优秀的喜剧能让我开心很久，我不怎么喜欢那种有深刻含义的复杂电影。,"Movies... Hmm, I prefer comedies. A good comedy can make me happy for a long time. I don’t really like those complex movies with deep meanings."""
Text/c0/text,那种往往大部分都是悲剧，也不是说悲剧不好啦，只是我更喜欢笑而已。(￣▽￣),"Those are mostly tragedies, not that tragedies are bad, I just prefer to laugh."" (￣▽￣)"
Text/c1/text,虽然，反正也没有人会真正理解我到底想什么，电影嘛，看的只是自己感觉对不对。,"Though, in the end, no one will really understand what I’m thinking. When it comes to movies, it’s all about whether it feels right to me."
Text/c2/text,你要是有喜欢的电影，也可以推荐给我，不过不要推荐那种太无聊的片子，我可不会陪你浪费时间。,"If you have any movies you like, feel free to recommend them to me, but don’t suggest any boring ones. I’m not going to waste my time watching them with you."
