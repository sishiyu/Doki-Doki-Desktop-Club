Text/ec/text,最近我也开始喜欢看一些关于心理学的书了，虽然它们有点复杂，但是其中讲到的很多理论其实挺有趣的。,"Recently, I've also started enjoying reading books about psychology. Although they’re a bit complex, many of the theories discussed are actually quite interesting."
Text/ed/text,比如，关于人的自我认知和情感管理的部分，有时候我会觉得那些理论挺接近我的想法的。,"For example, the parts about self-awareness and emotional management—sometimes I feel like those theories are very close to my own thoughts."
Text/ee/text,也许是因为自己在面对压力时常常感到迷茫，读这些书的时候，能够稍微找到一些理解自己的线索。,"Maybe it's because I often feel lost when facing pressure, and reading these books gives me some clues to better understand myself."
Text/ef/text,不过，有时候看得太多，又会担心自己是不是过于沉迷在这些理论里，反而忽略了生活本身的简单和真实。,"But sometimes, when I read too much, I start to worry if I'm becoming too absorbed in these theories, and in the process, overlooking the simplicity and reality of life itself."
