Text/99/text,我最近对情绪很感兴趣，当我对某件事产生情绪时，我会尝试着将自己置于第三人称视角，然后观察它，品尝它，不管是甜是苦，直到消退。,"I've recently become very interested in emotions. When I feel something strongly about a situation, I try to place myself in a third-person perspective and observe it, savoring it, whether it's sweet or bitter, until it fades away."
Text/9a/text,这很有趣，而且可以增强对情绪的掌控能力，你也应该尝试一下！,"It's quite interesting, and it helps strengthen your control over emotions. You should try it too!"
